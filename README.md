## Overview

Nexus is an advanced AI-powered software development platform that automates the entire software development lifecycle through a coordinated multi-agent system with recursive self-improvement capabilities. By orchestrating specialized AI agents—each responsible for a distinct phase of the development process—Nexus Flow can transform high-level requirements into production-ready codebases with minimal human intervention.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that focus on helping individual developers write better code, Nexus Flow represents a paradigm shift: a comprehensive system that handles the complete development pipeline from requirements analysis to deployment and maintenance.

### Why Nexus?

- **End-to-End Automation**: Automates the entire software development lifecycle
- **Specialized Agent Expertise**: Each phase is handled by agents specifically optimized for that task
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Agents continuously enhance their capabilities through recursive thought loops
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Robust monitoring, logging, isolation, and artifact management
- **Collaborative Approach**: Human developers can interact with any stage of the process

## Key Components

Nexus consists of six core components, each playing a vital role in the system:

### 1. LLM Adapter
- Wraps calls to OpenAI/GPT-style APIs with prompt templates
- Manages token budgets, rate limits, and caching of past calls
- Provides a consistent interface for all agent interactions with LLM models

### 2. Execution Sandbox
- Docker-based isolated containers per project
- Supports language runtimes (Node, Python, Go, etc.) and database mocks
- Creates safe environments for code testing and execution

### 3. Test Harness
- Pytest/Jest scaffold generator
- Hooks into sandbox to run tests and capture coverage reports
- Validates code quality and functionality

### 4. Orchestration Layer
- Schedules agent tasks and enforces retry policies
- Persists agent state across sessions
- Exposes REST/WebSocket interface for monitoring progress

### 5. Artifact Store
- Git-like storage for intermediate code, specs, and designs
- Enables rollbacks, diff-based repair, and human review
- Maintains history of all generated artifacts

### 6. Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized logs (ELK stack or similar) of prompts, responses, errors
- Metrics dashboard tracking latency, recursion counts, defect rates
- Provides visibility into the entire system

## Architecture

Nexus implements a pipeline of specialized AI agents, each with distinct responsibilities and recursive improvement capabilities:

### Agent Roles

- **Spec Agent**: Parses user prompts into formal requirements (JSON)
- **Design Agent**: Produces architecture diagrams and module breakdowns
- **Coder Agent**: Scaffolds code for each module
- **Test Agent**: Auto-generates unit/integration tests
- **Repair Agent**: Applies patches where tests or reviews fail
- **Review Agent**: Performs final audit (style, security, performance)

### Recursive Loop Logic

Each agent employs recursive self-improvement loops:

- **Spec Agent**: Generates 3 spec drafts, self-scores for completeness, selects top
- **Design Agent**: Explores 2-3 design variants, checks against spec for coverage
- **Coder Agent**: For each file: generate → lint/run static analyzer → repair → repeat
- **Test Agent**: Creates tests → runs tests → identifies gaps → adds tests
- **Repair Agent**: Receives failing code + diagnostics → iterates fixes
- **Review Agent**: Runs linters, security scanners, benchmarks → flags critical issues

### High-Level System Flow

```
[User Requirements]
         ↓
[Spec Agent] ⟲ (recursion) → [Design Agent]
         ↓                       ⟲ (recursion)
[Coder Agent] ⟲ (recursion) → [Test Agent]
         ↓                       ⟲ (recursion)
[Repair Agent] ⟲ (recursion) → [Review Agent]
         ↓
[CI/CD Orchestrator] → Deployed App
```

### Communication Infrastructure

- **Message Bus**: Redis Streams or RabbitMQ for inter-agent communication
- **State Store**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL to persist intermediate artifacts, prompts, and test results
- **Workflow Engine**: Lightweight controller (e.g., Temporal.io or custom) to manage agent invocation, retries, and branching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and Python 3.10+
- 32GB+ RAM recommended for full system deployment
- API access to a supported LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexus-flow.git
   cd nexus-flow
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

3. Start the system:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Submit your first project:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/projects \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Hello World", "description": "Create a simple REST API with user authentication"}'
   ```

5. Monitor progress through the dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/dashboard
   ```

### Configuration

Nexus is highly configurable. Key settings include:

- **LLM Selection**: Configure which models to use for which agents
- **Agent Parameters**: Fine-tune recursion depth, confidence thresholds, etc.
- **Sandbox Resources**: Adjust CPU/memory limits for execution environments
- **Review Rules**: Set rule severity and enforcement levels

See the [Configuration Guide](./docs/configuration.md) for detailed options.

## Use Cases

Nexus excels in various development scenarios:

### Internal Tool Development
Generate full-stack applications for internal business processes without dedicating engineering resources.

### API Development
Build and maintain APIs with comprehensive testing and documentation from high-level specifications.

### Prototype Acceleration
Turn proof-of-concept ideas into working prototypes in a fraction of the usual time.

### Legacy System Modernization
Analyze and refactor legacy codebases with agents specialized in understanding and modernizing older code.

### Educational Platform
Learning environments where students can see how requirements translate to design, code, and tests.

## Roadmap

Our development roadmap includes:

- **Q3 2025**: Add support for more programming languages and frameworks
- **Q4 2025**: Implement multi-project coordination for system-of-systems development
- **Q1 2026**: Integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines and issue trackers
- **Q2 2026**: Expand agent capabilities to include UX/UI design and generation
- **Q3 2026**: Release enterprise features including compliance validation agents
